# Project README

## Project Description

- Develop a web application using Next.js and Supabase to implement semantic search functionality for a table named projects.
- The projects table will contain fields such as description, tagline, and name for each project.
- Users will be able to search for projects using natural language queries with semantic search capabilities.
- Implement a user-friendly interface where users can input their search queries.
- Leverage Supabase's authentication and database functionalities to securely store and retrieve project information.
- Utilize Next.js for server-side rendering to enhance performance and SEO capabilities.
- Include features for filtering search results based on project attributes like name or tagline.
- Implement real-time search updates to display results as users type their queries.
- Enhance the search functionality with autocomplete suggestions for popular search terms.
- Incorporate responsive design to ensure optimal user experience across devices.
- Implement a robust error handling system to provide informative feedback to users in case of search failures.
- Optimize the application for speed and efficiency by minimizing unnecessary API calls and database queries.
- Include a feature for users to save their favorite projects for future reference.
- Enhance the project with advanced search features such as fuzzy matching and synonym recognition for more accurate results.
- Provide clear documentation for users on how to utilize the semantic search functionality effectively.
